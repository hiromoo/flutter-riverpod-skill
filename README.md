# Flutter Riverpod Skill

An agent skill for Codex and Claude Code for designing and building Flutter applications with Riverpod. Use it when starting a new app, adding features, or incrementally refactoring an existing application.

[English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

## Principles

- Use Flutter's official [Architecture Best Practices skill](https://github.com/flutter/agent-plugins/blob/main/skills/flutter-apply-architecture-best-practices/SKILL.md) as the architectural baseline, with additional guidance for Riverpod.
- Organize code by feature and use Riverpod `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier`, Freezed, and `flutter_hooks`.
- Pin the verified Flutter SDK with FVM and `.fvmrc` for new Flutter projects.
- Generate API clients from OpenAPI specifications with OpenAPI Generator's `dart-dio` generator.
- Use a centralized UI theme, Flutter `gen_l10n` for localization, and type-safe `go_router` routes.
- Consult additional Flutter agent skills when they fit the task; do not duplicate their contents here.

## Usage

The skill instructions are in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md); focused guidance is available in [`references/`](references/). The same files work with both Codex and Claude Code.

### Codex

Place this repository where Codex can use it as a skill, then invoke the `flutter-riverpod-skill` skill for Flutter development tasks.

### Claude Code

Clone this repository into a Claude Code skills directory, keeping `flutter-riverpod-skill` as the directory name:

```sh
# Available in all projects
git clone https://github.com/hiromoo/riverpod_ai_docs.git ~/.claude/skills/flutter-riverpod-skill

# Or only in one project (run from the project root)
git clone https://github.com/hiromoo/riverpod_ai_docs.git .claude/skills/flutter-riverpod-skill
```

If you already have a local clone, symlink it instead, for example `ln -s "$PWD" ~/.claude/skills/flutter-riverpod-skill`. Claude Code loads the skill automatically for matching Flutter tasks; you can also invoke it explicitly with `/flutter-riverpod-skill`.

## Sample app

[Reading Shelf](examples/reading_shelf/README.md) is a Flutter web app with a Shelf API. Use it to explore the recommended structure, code generation, and testing approach. It runs without an external API key.

## Evaluation

Reproducible implementation evaluations compare GPT-6 Luna with and without this skill, with GPT-6 Astra grading and independent Flutter/Dart checks. See [the evaluation guide](EVALUATION.md) for the fixed cases, commands, and limitations.

The [initial measured result](benchmarks/iteration-1.md) found higher functional and convention pass rates with the skill, while also showing substantial time/token overhead and several conventions that Luna still applied inconsistently. After adding a convention checklist, [iteration 2](benchmarks/iteration-2.md) raised the skill's convention pass rate from 27.3% to 81.8% with unchanged functional results, though one refactor run regressed on a disposal check. [Iteration 3](benchmarks/iteration-3.md) reached 11/11 on conventions and passed every mechanical check, but its functional pass rate fell to 4/7 because of retry and race defects that the withheld tests did not cover. [Iteration 4](benchmarks/iteration-4.md) fixed both defects and added an independent regeneration check to the harness. The skill-assisted runs then reached 6/7 functional, 11/11 conventions, and 3/3 mechanical passes, at about 2.2 times the baseline's solver time.
